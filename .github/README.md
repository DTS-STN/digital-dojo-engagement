## Description

Digital Dojo 2.0 Application

### Technologies Implemented

This project uses

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing.

#### Configuring Helm

In the helm template, the application name is next-template. this will need to be changed by the current application name.

For every Kubernetes cluster, a context.sh file needs to be defined. For example, one might be called context-dev.sh and the other context-prod.sh.
