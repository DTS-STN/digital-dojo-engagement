    'Continuous planning involves monitoring goals, metrics, and milestones for existing priorities; identifying, developing, and advancing new strategic priorities; and ensuring a culture of self-evaluation, innovation, agility, and adaptability.',
  'continuous-collaboration-blurb':
    "Continuous collaboration means enabling teams to innovate before, during, and after meetings. Collaboration isn't a series of discrete, unconnected events (like  meetings), or one-off conversations (like phone calls), or even string  of discussions in email",
  'continuous-improvement-blurb':
    'Continuous improvement is a process of improving quality and efficiency by making small, incremental changes over time. In Kanban, continuous  improvement refers specifically to the process of optimizing workflow  and reducing cycle time, resulting in increased productivity.',
  'continuous-quality-blurb':
    'Continuous quality, sometimes referred to as Performance and Quality Improvement (PQI), is a process of creating an environment in which management and workers strive to create constantly improving quality.',
  'continuous-integration-blurb':
    'Continuous integration is a software engineering practice that involves continual integration of new development code into the existing  codebase.',
  'continuous-delivery-blurb':
    'Continuous delivery is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, without doing so manually. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency.',
  'continuous-operations-blurb':
    'Continuous operations are the core activities within a business or organization that  are ongoing and sustained in the event of a business disruption.',
  'continuous-security-blurb':
    'Continuous security is used to address security concerns and testing in the Continuous Delivery pipeline, and is as much a part of continuous delivery as operations, testing, or security is a part of the DevOps culture... Automated testing is fundamental',
  'continuous-user-feedback-blurb':
    'Continuous user feedback is essential to application release and deployment because it evaluates the effect of each release on the user experience and then reports that evaluation back to the DevOps team to improve future releases.',
