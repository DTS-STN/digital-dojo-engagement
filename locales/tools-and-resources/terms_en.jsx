          The Acceptance Criteria specify a set of conditions that the solution
          must meet in order to satisfy the customer. The product owner or
          client representative writes statements from the customer’s point of
          view that explain how a user story or feature should work. In order
          for the story or feature to be accepted it needs to pass the
          acceptance criteria; otherwise, it fails.

          A blocker / impediment is any obstacle that prevents an individual or
          team from completing a task or project. Unscheduled meetings,
          technical issues, lack of knowledge or expertise, a distracting
          workplace, and office conflict are all examples of impediments.

          create a list of impediments called an Impediment Backlog and
          prominently display this list in the area where the team meets for
          Daily Scrums. Impediments should be listed by how seriously they are
          hindering team productivity. If the impediments are company-wide, it
          is the Scrum Master’s responsibility to remove them. If they are
          occurring at a team level, it is the team’s responsibility to resolve
          or remove them.

          An iteration is a fixed or timeboxed period of time, generally
          spanning two to four weeks, during which an Agile team develops a
          deliverable, potentially shippable product. A typical Agile project
          consists of a series of iterations, along with a planning meeting
          prior to development and a retrospective meeting at the end of the
          iteration. Iterations are referred to as sprints in Scrum.

        <p>
          As a member of the Agile team, the Product Owner represents the
          customer, and conveys the customer’s requirements and vision to the
          team. The product owner writes the acceptance criteria, and
          prioritizes and maintains the product backlog. Product owners should
          be able to communicate well in both directions: both taking team
          concerns to the customer and stakeholders, and ensuring that the team
          stays on track to meet the customer’s vision for the product.

        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">How it’s Used: </span>In a Scrum
          environment, the product owner assembles and prioritizes the user
          stories to be completed during a sprint. During the sprint, the
          product owner remains silent; he or she cannot make changes or offer
          feedback. Once the sprint is complete, the product owner meets with
          team members and stakeholders to offer feedback and discuss avenues
          for improvement. The product owner accepts or rejects the product at
          the end of the sprint, based on the acceptance criteria decided on
          during the spring planning meeting.

        <p>
          In a Kanban environment, the Product Owner assembles and prioritizes a
          backlog of work items to be accomplished. The product owner has the
          flexibility to change and reprioritize work in the backlog at any time
          without affecting work already in progress.

          An Agile release refers to the final delivery of a software package
          after the completion of multiple iterations or sprints. A release can
          be either the initial build of an application or the addition of one
          or more features to an existing application. A release should take
          less than a year to complete, and in some cases, may only take three
          months.

          Technical debt refers to the obligation a development team incurs when
          they use a short-term, expedient approach to developing a software
          package without considering the long-term consequences. Technical debt
          increases project cost and complexity due to inefficiencies,
          inaccuracies, and other issues introduced into the software package.
          Poor management, incompetency, timeline pressure, or inadvertent
          mistakes can all contribute to technical debt.

        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">How it’s Used:</span> Technical debt is
          used as a motivation for the team to focus on quality and added value

          consistently refactoring and reviewing code, running automated unit
          tests, and integrating code on a consistent basis. Pair programming is
          often helpful in guarding against technical debt. Creating an
          environment where team members are encouraged to increase relevant
